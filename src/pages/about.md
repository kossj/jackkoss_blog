# About Jack

---

I'm a college student who's a bit lost but really enthusiastic!

## What I do

My interest in engineering started in elementary school, where I joined my school's VEX IQ team. Since then I've participated in VIQ, VRC, BEST, FRC, and mentored VIQ. The most important lessons I learned were social: how and how _not_ to work with others.

As I get to TAMU, I'm going for map completion: I want to explore as much of that campus as I can manage.

## Behind the Scenes

When I'm not procrastinating on my homework, you'll find me:

- Messing with my brother
- Practicing my violin
- Exploring new study spots
- Destroying the MSC Panda Express :p

## Let's Connect

Want to connect? I'm always happy to chat with others, whether to collaborate or just share a story. Hmu!
